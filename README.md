*✈️ Flight Price Prediction using Linear Regression:*

**This project aims to analyze flight booking data obtained from the Ease My Trip platform and apply statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights. The primary objective is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to forecast flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, and more.
**

**🔍 Objective**
Perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand patterns and trends in flight pricing.
Conduct various statistical hypothesis tests to derive meaningful insights from the data.
Build and train a Linear Regression model to predict flight prices accurately.


**📊 Dataset Source**
The dataset was scraped from Ease My Trip, an online flight booking platform used by passengers to purchase tickets.
🚀 Key Features
Data Analysis & Visualization: Gain insights into flight pricing trends.
Statistical Testing: Hypothesis tests for identifying significant variables that impact flight prices.
Predictive Modeling: Develop and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict continuous target variables (flight prices).

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Linear Regression Algorithm
Jupyter Notebook

**📈 Expected Outcomes**
The project helps potential passengers make informed decisions by predicting flight prices and understanding the key factors affecting pricing. The insights from this analysis can improve decision-making for flight booking and travel planning.
